# Assignment B1: Creating and Testing a Function in R

This repository contains the files for Assignment B1 in the STAT545B course, which involves creating, documenting, and testing a function in R. The assignment focuses on building a custom function that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a specified numeric column within a dataset.

# Using This Repository

_Function_: The calc_mean_sd function can be found in Assignment-B1.Rmd. This function takes a data frame and the name of a numeric column as input and returns a list containing the mean and standard deviation of that column.

_Examples_: Usage examples are included in Assignment-B1.Rmd to demonstrate how to call the calc_mean_sd function on sample datasets. The examples include handling of NA values and error handling for non-numeric inputs.
